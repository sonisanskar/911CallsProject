# 911CallsProject
Extracted, interpreted and cleaned data to get rid of null values and classified the reasons for making 911 calls. Derived new columns to segregate data by demographics, city, season, date-time and plotted countplot for the same. Created lmplot for linear fit on number of calls per month and plotted heatmaps in reference to the cause of calls.
